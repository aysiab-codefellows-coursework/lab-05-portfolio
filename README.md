# Porfolio 
### Aysia Brown
*Repurposed from 301 to practice AWS deployment*

- [GUI deployment](http://aysiabrownportfolio-env.eba-ynvkxw5u.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/)
- [CLI deployment](http://my-env.eba-mik7uqtf.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

The biggest obstacle I ran into was initially that my old AWS account I had made back in college was suspended. I did end up looking up the docs for the eb cli using home brew and beyond that everything went swimmingly.
